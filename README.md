 Worldwide Billionaire Analysis Project README
Introduction
This repository houses the code and resources related to a dissertation project focusing on ensemble learning techniques. The project particularly emphasises the use of XG Boost and Bagging Classifier with Logistic Regression as the models for predictive modelling. The research aims to evaluate the performance efficiency of the ensemble model through various metrics such as accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC).
